# Simple NFT example
This is a simple example we created and published to Testnet so that we can make test Move smart contract calls from our sample code. It was taken from [this sample project](https://docs.movementnetwork.xyz/devs/firstMoveContract).

## To publish
1. Make sure your Movement CLI is [installed and up-to-date](https://docs.movementnetwork.xyz/devs/movementcli).
2. Make sure your CLI account has some Move (use the [Testnet faucet](https://faucet.movementnetwork.xyz/) if needed).
3. In this directory, run the following in your terminal: movement move build
4. Once the build process is complete, run: movement move publish
